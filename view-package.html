                        <p>Udagamandalam was originally a tribal land occupied
                            by the Toda along with other hill tribes who
                            coexisted through specialisation and trade. The
                            major tribes of Nilgiris area are the Toda, Baduga,
                            Kota, Irula and Kurumba. The old Tamil work
                            Silappadikaram states that the Chera king
                            Senguttuvan, who ruled during the 2nd century CE, on
                            his way to the Himalayas in the north, stayed in the
                            Nilgiris and witnessed the dance of the Kannadigas.
                            The Toda in the Nilgiris are first referenced in a
                            record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and
                            his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE.The Toda people
                            were known for raising water buffalo. The Tamil and
                            Badaga people known for farming activities. Nilgiris
                            was ruled by various dynasties like Satavahanas,
                            Cheras, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Cholas,
                            Hoysalas, the Vijayanagara empire and the Rajas of
                            Ummattur (on behalf of Wodeyars of Mysuru). The
                            Nilgiris came into possession of British East India
                            Company as part of the ceded lands, held by Tipu
                            Sultan, by the treaty of Srirangapatnam in 1799. The
                            road was completed in May 1823, and extended up to
                            Coonoor by 1830-32.. Ooty served as the summer
                            capital of the Madras Presidency; it was visited by
                            British officials during the colonial days as a
                            popular summer resort.</p>
